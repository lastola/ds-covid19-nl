# ds-covid19-nl

Analyses and visualizations used in this [study/paper/presentation] were produced with the Giovanni online data system, developed and maintained by the NASA GES DISC.

This is a hobby project on combining different data sources and examining their relation.

Project contains 3 jupyter notebooks: 
Covid_NL_per_municipality.ipynb, 
Read_NASA_NO2_NC_file.ipynb, and
covid_with_geopandas.ipynb


Environments: 
it is easiest to run the latter two in their own conda environments, because the second uses library netCDF4 and the third uses the library geopandas.
